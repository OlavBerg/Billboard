Step 1:
Connect each of your Ardinos to their own LCD. Click here for a guide on how to do so: https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/LibraryExamples/HelloWorld
 
Step 2:
Connect your Arduinos to your computer.
 
Step 3:
In the Arduino IDE, open the file "lcd_loop/lcd_loop.ino". For each of your Arduinos, click on "Tools" -> "Port: ..." and select the port the Arduino is connected to, then click on "Upload" (the right-pointing arrow at the top-left corner) to upload the program to the Arduino.
 
Step 4:
To compile, type "g++ *.cpp".

Step 5:
To run (on Windows), type "./a.exe [port1] [port2] [port3] ..." where [port1], [port2] etc are the names of the serial ports connectected to your Arduinos.
